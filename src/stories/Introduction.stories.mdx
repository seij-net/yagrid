# Welcome to YAGrid

YAGrid helps you build tables using React. YAGrid goals are

* lightweight and extensible
* plugin system
* zero design, you get full control on markup and styles
* built-in editing
* strong typing
* to be very configurable

YAGrid had been created for usage in management software
where you'll find a lot of tables, where common logic can be reused easily.

YAGrid makes no assumptions on styling at all. It means you can use it with any styling framework you want.
